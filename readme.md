![flow diagram](src/main/resources/linked-in-profile-searcher-flow.jpeg)

There are 3 APIs in this microservice.

1. /api/v1/linked-in/search -> which accepts payload that includes universityName, graduationYear and CurrentDesignation
   + This API accepts the paylaod and searches whether the response is present in db or not
       + If present, return the response to the client
       + else trigger PhantomBuster LinkedIn search export phantom, save the PhantomAgentTask and return tracking id.
   + There is a scheduled job in the microservice which runs for every 2 minutes (configurable based on the traffic) and picks the phantomAgentTaskEntities that are pending, extracts phantom container id from them and triggers phantoms API to fetch the profile response.
   + If response is present, save the response in db and mark PhantomAgentTask Completed.
   + If error occurred, mark the phantomAgentTask failed.
   + If no response/still scraping, increment the retry count of PhantomAgentTask, if retry count is already incremented mark task as failed.

2. /api/v1/linked-in/fetch/{trackingId}
   + This Api returns the saved data that job saves by fetching it from PhantomBuster using trackingId.
   + Pass the trackingId you got in /api/v1/linked-in/search apis response.
   + If the data is available the api returns the Alumni LinkedIn profile data.
   + If the task got marked as failed by the job, returns error.
   + If the task still in pending state, gives relevant message.

3. /api/v1/linked-in/fetch/all
   + This API is used to fetch all the Alumni LinkedIn profile data from the database.
